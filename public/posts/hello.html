                        <h1 id="article-title">Welcome to my Blog</h1>
                    </header>
                    <p>Hello! I’m <strong>Vihaan</strong>, and I am currently full-stack developer from Australia that is passionate about technology, coding, and creating engaging digital experiences such as websites, <strong>like this one</strong>. This is the very first post on my blog, and I’m excited to start sharing my thoughts, tutorials, and insights with you. I will try to create fun, bite-sized content, which you can take in and learn new and budding topics in the technological world.</p>
<h2>What You’ll Find on This Blog</h2>
<p>This blog focuses on topics that I’m deeply interested in, including:</p>
<h3>1. Web Development</h3>
<p>From the basics of HTML and CSS to advanced frameworks like React and Node.js, I will be able to share tutorials, guides, and real-world examples and scenarios to fuel you to build modern, responsive websites, and applications. You’ll also find tips for using tools such as code editors like git VS Code, including Git, and GitHub efficiently. This is essential if you are trying to land a job, or build a start-up, and you are not too far from doing so!</p>
<h3>2. Coding Tips and Best Practices</h3>
<p>Writing code is not just about functionality, it’s also about readability, maintainability, and efficiency. I will cover various and spontaneous subjects such as debugging tips, and methods for writing clean and optimised code that’s easier to manage. These epic tips will be useful for beginners and professionals too, and I am trying to form an atmosphere which can adhere to all ages.</p>
<h3>3. Technology Insights</h3>
<p>The acceleration of technology is fast, and keeping up with fresh trends can be overwhelming as the internet is collossal. However, I can share insights about new tools, frameworks, and software throughout the way, along with my own personal recommendations. Whether its a productivity app, a coding library, or a new programming language, you’ll find updates and opinions that are practical and actionable, and can embed them in your own programs and codebases.</p>
<h3>4. Step-by-Step Guides</h3>
<p>Some of my principles is that <strong>learning and executing</strong> is the best approach. That’s why I will post step-by-step tutorials and articles for building projects, from small experiments to full-fledged websites and programs. Each brief and concise guide will include code snippets, examples, and explanations so you can follow along easily.</p>
<h3>5. Personal Experiences</h3>
<p>In addition to tutorials, I will also be able to share my personal experiences in tech and development. As I have been programming for 4+ years, this includes challenges I’ve faced, lessons learned, and advice that can help you avoid common obstacles and steep learning curves while developing your skills. It is important to understand not just code, but the cost of creating it.</p>
<h2>Why This Blog Exists</h2>
<p>I recently began this blog as a <strong>high-quality, useful resource</strong> for anyone interested in programming and technology, and are wanting to rely on a friendly site. Many blogs focus on short tips or clickbait content, but I aim to provide <strong>original and valuable content</strong> that readers can actually use and implement to improve their skills and knowledge.</p>
<h2>Get in Touch</h2>
