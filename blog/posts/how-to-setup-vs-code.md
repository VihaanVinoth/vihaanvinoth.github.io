Let's say you've been dreaming about making that one website, but, you are using a not-so-great application that relies only on you with your skills like Notepad. We're going to use VSC, also known as Visual Studio Code which is the hallmark for programmers because it is a code editor. There's many editors in the 21st century, but VS Code include capabilities which are unmatched from many.



## Installing Visual Studio Code

Firstly, go to the official VSC website at https://code.visualstudio.com.

Simply click the blue button (aka the most stable version) to download to the code editor. On the top of the screen where the address bar is, you should see that the file is downloading; it's the blue down arrow on the right.

Now once you have downloaded the file, it may show you some prompts. Press 'Ok' or 'Yes' for all of them.



## Installing the Live Server Extension

Once you've installed VS Code, you can open the application. However, we're not done just yet... we will need to install Live Server Extension - which will allow us to host a preview server on your network. On the sidebar, just press the icon which has the four squares on it.

Now when you are in the section, type in the search bar 'live server' and press the top option. For me it shows two buttons, 'Disable' and 'Uninstall', but for you it will only say 'Install'.

## Conclusion

Woohoo! You have successfully installed VS Code. Now you just have to press the file icon on the sidebar, drag a folder and start developiing! Overall, you have now learnt how to install and setup Visual Studio Code to prepare to code websites.
